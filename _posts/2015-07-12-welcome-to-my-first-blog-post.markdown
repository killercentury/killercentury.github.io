Recently, I start to realise that there are lots of things I really want to share to the community, which cannot be archived without a well written blog. So I will start to use this space to talk about software engineering or whatever technology is interesting to me.

Technically saying, this is not my first blog post. I have a very old tech blog a few year ago that logs every detail problem I meet and how I solve them. But this blog will be definitely different in terms of quality and orientation.
