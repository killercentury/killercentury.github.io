Recently, I start to realise that there are lots of things I really want to share to the community, which cannot be archived without a well written blog. So I will start to use this space to talk about software engineering or whatever technology is interesting to me.

Technically saying, this is not my first blog post. I have a very old tech blog back to a few years ago that logs every detail problem I meet and how I solve them. But this blog will  definitely be different in terms of quality and orientation. It will not be about fixing little problem that probably won't last for months. Instead, the content will try to be more generic and reusable over time.
