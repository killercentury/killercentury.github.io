My name is Kira Cheung (formal name as Decheng Zhang). I'm a software engineer who loves all sort of technologies, such as functional reactive programming, distributed systems, continuous delivery and so on.

I am currently working at Ausmed Education which provides a modern online education platform for nurses. I am helping to re-architect the next generation of platform based on microservices architecture. I also build various services from frontend to backend, while very emphasize on engineering techniques to enable continous delivery. Previously, I worked in HSBC for some high volume transaction banking systems.

I personally take part in a few open source projects such as [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker) and [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform) and like to share some code examples on Github. My Github profile can be found here https://github.com/killercentury

I often tweet about various technologies, thinking and trends on Twitter. Please follow me on <https://twitter.com/killercentury>
